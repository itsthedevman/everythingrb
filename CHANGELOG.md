## [0.9.0] - 12025-08-01

### Added

- **Added `Hash#compact_blank_merge` and `Hash#compact_blank_merge!`** - Merge only present (non-blank) values when ActiveSupport is loaded. Filters out nil, empty strings, empty arrays, false, and other blank values according to ActiveSupport's definition.
- Added `with_index` parameter to `Hash#join_map` for API consistency with `Array#join_map`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Renamed `Hash#merge_compact` to `Hash#compact_merge`** - Updated method naming for consistency with other operation-first methods like `compact_prefix`, `trim_nils`, etc. The old method names will be removed in this version.
- **BREAKING: Renamed `Hash#merge_compact!` to `Hash#compact_merge!`** - In-place version follows the same naming convention.

### Removed

- **BREAKING: Removed `Hash#merge_compact` and `Hash#merge_compact!`** - These methods have been renamed to `Hash#compact_merge` and `Hash#compact_merge!` respectively for naming consistency.
- **Removed deprecated Hash value filtering methods** - `Hash#select_values`, `Hash#select_values!`, `Hash#reject_values`, `Hash#reject_values!`, and `Hash#filter_values`, `Hash#filter_values!` have been removed as planned. These methods were deprecated in v0.8.3. Use the standard Ruby alternatives instead:
  - `hash.select_values { |v| condition }` → `hash.select { |k, v| condition }`
  - `hash.reject_values { |v| condition }` → `hash.reject { |k, v| condition }`
  - For blank filtering: `hash.reject_values(&:blank?)` → `hash.compact_blank` (with ActiveSupport)

## [0.8.3] - 12025-05-31

### Added

### Changed

- **Deprecated Hash value filtering methods** - `Hash#select_values`, `Hash#reject_values`, `Hash#select_values!` and `Hash#reject_values!` are now deprecated and will be removed in v0.9.0. These methods largely duplicate existing Ruby/ActiveSupport functionality:

  - `hash.reject_values(&:blank?)` → use `hash.compact_blank` instead
  - `hash.select_values { |v| condition }` → use `hash.select { |k, v| condition }`
  - `hash.reject_values { |v| condition }` → use `hash.reject { |k, v| condition }`

  See [Issue #61](https://github.com/itsthedevman/everythingrb/issues/61) for full details.

### Removed

## [0.8.2] - 12025-05-25

### Added

### Changed

- Fixed `Hash#rename_key_unordered` and `Hash#rename_key_unordered!` to not create new key-value pairs when the original key doesn't exist. Previously, these methods would incorrectly add the `new_key` to the hash even when `old_key` was missing.

### Removed

## [0.8.1] - 12025-05-21

### Added

- Added configuration option for Rails for granular control
  ```ruby
  # In config/initializers/everythingrb.rb
  Rails.application.configure do
    config.everythingrb.extensions = [:array, :string, :hash]
  end
  ```

### Fixed

- Fixed Rails compatibility with a Railtie to resolve a crash caused by load order

## [0.8.0] - 12025-05-11

### Added

- Added conditional hash merging methods:
  - `Hash#merge_if` and `Hash#merge_if!` - Merge key-value pairs based on a condition
  - `Hash#merge_if_values` and `Hash#merge_if_values!` - Merge based on values only
  - `Hash#merge_compact` and `Hash#merge_compact!` - Merge only non-nil values
- Added `String#to_camelcase` - Converts strings to camelCase/PascalCase while handling spaces, hyphens, underscores, and special characters
  - Supports both lowercase first letter (`:lower`) and uppercase first letter (`:upper`), which is default

### Changed

- Updated documentation

### Removed

- Removed potentially dangerous `Array#deep_freeze` and `Hash#deep_freeze` methods to prevent accidental freezing of classes and singleton objects. This creates a safer API for the 1.0.0 milestone.

## [0.7.0] - 12025-05-04

### Added

- Created `Everythingrb::InspectQuotable` and `Everythingrb::StringQuotable` modules for consistent quote functionality
- Extended quotable functionality to many more Ruby core classes:
  - `TrueClass` and `FalseClass` (boolean values)
  - `NilClass`
  - `Numeric`
  - `Range`
  - `Regexp`
  - `Time`, `Date`, and `DateTime`
  - `Data` and `Struct` classes
- Added new Hash methods for filtering based on values only:
  - `Hash#select_values` - Returns a new hash with entries where the block returns true for the value
  - `Hash#select_values!` - Same as `select_values` but modifies the hash in place
  - `Hash#reject_values` - Returns a new hash with entries where the block returns false for the value
  - `Hash#reject_values!` - Same as `reject_values` but modifies the hash in place
  - Added `filter_values` and `filter_values!` as aliases for `select_values` and `select_values!` respectively
- Added `Kernel#morph` as an alias for `then` (and `yield_self`) that better communicates transformation intent:

  ```ruby
  # Instead of this:
  value.then { |v| transform_somehow(v) }

  # You can write this:
  value.morph { |v| transform_somehow(v) }
  ```

### Changed

- Refactored existing quotable implementations to use the new modules
- Standardized method order to prefer `in_quotes` as the primary method with `with_quotes` as an alias

### Removed

## [0.6.1] - 12025-04-26

### Changed

- Fixed invalid use of `private` in `Hash` when ActiveSupport is enabled. This unintentionally caused other public methods to be private

## [0.6.0] - 12025-04-26

### BREAKING CHANGES:

- **Replaced method-based `with_key` approach with direct parameter**:
  The chainable `.with_key` method approach has been replaced with a more straightforward parameter-based approach.

  **Before:**

  ```ruby
  hash.transform_values.with_key { |value, key| "#{key}:#{value}" }
  hash.transform_values!.with_key { |value, key| "#{key}:#{value}" }
  ```

  **After:**

  ```ruby
  hash.transform_values(with_key: true) { |value, key| "#{key}:#{value}" }
  hash.transform_values!(with_key: true) { |value, key| "#{key}:#{value}" }
  ```

### Added:

- Added ActiveSupport integration for deep transforms with key access:
  - `Hash#deep_transform_values(with_key: true)`
  - `Hash#deep_transform_values!(with_key: true)`

## [0.5.0] - 12025-04-17

**BREAKING:**

The parameter order in `Hash#transform_values.with_key` has been changed to yield `|value, key|` instead of `|key, value|` to maintain consistency with Ruby's standard enumeration methods like `each_with_index`.

**Before:**

```ruby
hash.transform_values.with_key { |key, value| "#{key}: #{value}" }
```

**After:**

```ruby
hash.transform_values.with_key { |value, key| "#{key}: #{value}" }
```

This change aligns our method signatures with Ruby's conventions and matches our other methods like `join_map(with_index: true)` which yields `|value, index|`.

### Added

- Added `Hash#transform` and `Hash#transform!` for transforming a hash's keys and values at the same time.

### Changed

- Changed parameter order in `Hash#transform_values.with_key` to yield `|value, key|` instead of `|key, value|` for consistency with Ruby conventions.

### Removed

## [0.4.0] - 12025-04-11

### Added

- Added new `Hash` methods for renaming keys:
  - `#rename_key` - Renames a key in the hash while preserving the original order of elements
  - `#rename_key!` - Same as `#rename_key` but modifies the hash in place
  - `#rename_keys` - Renames multiple keys in the hash while preserving the original order of elements
  - `#rename_keys!` - Same as `#rename_keys` but modifies the hash in place
  - `#rename_key_unordered` - Renames a key without preserving element order (faster operation)
  - `#rename_key_unordered!` - Same as `#rename_key_unordered` but modifies the hash in place
- Added `to_deep_h` to core Ruby classes for consistent deep hash conversion:
  - `Struct#to_deep_h` - Recursively converts Struct objects and all nested values to hashes
  - `OpenStruct#to_deep_h` - Recursively converts OpenStruct objects and all nested values to hashes
  - `Data#to_deep_h` - Recursively converts Data objects and all nested values to hashes
- Added `depth` parameter to `Hash.new_nested_hash` to control nesting behaviors

- Added `Enumerable#group_by_key`, group an array of hashes by their keys
- Added `Hash#new_nested_hash`, creates a new Hash that automatically initializes the value to a hash
- Added `Hash#value_where` and `Hash#values_where`, easily find values in a hash based on key-value conditions

### Changed

  - `compact_prefix` - Removes nil values from the beginning of an array
  - `compact_suffix` - Removes nil values from the end of an array
  - `trim_nils` - Removes nil values from both ends of an array
  - ActiveSupport integration with blank-aware versions:
    - `compact_blank_prefix` - Removes blank values from the beginning
    - `compact_blank_suffix` - Removes blank values from the end
    - `trim_blanks` - Removes blank values from both ends
